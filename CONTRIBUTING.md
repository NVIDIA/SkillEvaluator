# Contributing

Contributions are welcome through GitHub pull requests.

## Before Opening A Pull Request

- Discuss substantial changes in an issue first.
- Keep provider credentials, customer data, and private benchmark material out
  of the repository.
- Add focused tests for behavioral changes.
- Run `make lint`, `make test`, and `make build` locally.
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) when the change affects users.

## Pull Requests

Use the pull request template, keep each pull request focused, and explain the
user-visible behavior and verification performed. By submitting a contribution,
you confirm that you have the right to contribute it under the
[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies
  that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it
  under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
    accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
  committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
